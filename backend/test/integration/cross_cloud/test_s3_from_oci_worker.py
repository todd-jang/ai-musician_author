# Import the actual service code that makes the S3 call
from backend.app.services import s3_service
# Import logging (assuming it's configured in the execution environment)
import logging

# Get a logger for this test module
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# --- Test Setup (Conceptual - done OUTSIDE this code file) ---
# 1. Deploy Worker to OCI environment (e.g., OKE cluster or OCI Compute VM).
# 2. Create an S3 bucket in AWS.
# 3. Upload a test file (e.g., test_sheetmusic.pdf) to the AWS S3 bucket.
# 4. Configure the OCI Worker environment with AWS credentials that have permission
#    to access the specific S3 bucket and object. (Environment variables, IAM roles if OCI supports cross-cloud identity federation, or config file).
#    Example: Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables
#    in the OCI Worker deployment.
# 5. Ensure OCI network configuration (Security Lists/Network Security Groups) and
#    AWS network configuration (Security Groups, Network ACLs) allow traffic
#    between the OCI Worker and the AWS S3 service endpoints. This usually involves
#    NAT, Internet Gateway, or more securely, VPN/Direct Connect/FastConnect.
# 6. Ensure the OCI Worker environment has network access to the internet
#    to resolve AWS S3 endpoints.

# --- Test Execution (Conceptual - this code runs IN THE OCI WORKER ENVIRONMENT) ---
# This test file is part of the test suite that gets deployed and run within the OCI Worker environment.
# For example, it could be run by pytest inside a test runner container or script
# executing within the OCI Worker's deployment.

# --- Pytest Fixtures (Minimal mocking for integration test) ---

# Fixture to get necessary environment variables (assumes they are set in OCI env)
@pytest.fixture

    # These env vars must be set in the OCI Worker's execution environment

    aws_s3_test_object_key = os.getenv("AWS_S3_TEST_OBJECT_KEY")
    local_download_path_base = "/tmp/cross_cloud_tests" # A path inside the OCI Worker container/VM
