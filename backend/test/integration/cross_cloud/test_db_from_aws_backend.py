# --- Test Setup (Conceptual - done OUTSIDE this code file) ---
# 1. Deploy Backend API to AWS environment (e.g., EKS cluster or EC2 VM).
# 2. Deploy Database (PostgreSQL) to OCI environment (e.g., OCI DB service or VM).
# 3. Configure the AWS Backend environment with OCI Database connection details
#    (hostname/IP, port, dbname, user, password). Environment variables are common.
#    Example: Set OCI_DB_HOST, OCI_DB_PORT, etc. in the AWS Backend deployment.
# 4. Configure AWS network (Security Groups) and OCI network (Security Lists/Network Security Groups, DB system access rules)
#    to allow traffic from the AWS Backend to the OCI Database port (usually 5432 for PostgreSQL).
# 5. Ensure network connectivity between AWS and OCI (VPN/Peering).
# 6. Ensure the OCI Database is accessible from the AWS Backend network space.
# 7. Run db/init.sql on the OCI Database instance to create the necessary tables.

# --- Test Execution (Conceptual - this code runs IN THE AWS BACKEND ENVIRONMENT) ---
# This test file is part of the test suite that gets deployed and run within the AWS Backend environment.

# --- Pytest Fixtures ---

# Fixture to set the PRIMARY_DB_TYPE and mock DB pool setup for this test run
# Note: We are setting PRIMARY_DB_TYPE to postgresql here to use the postgresql path in db_service,
# but the CONNECTION DETAILS (PG_CONFIG env vars) in the AWS env must point to the OCI DB.

def set_db_config_for_cross_cloud_test(mocker):
    original_db_type = os.getenv("PRIMARY_DB_TYPE")
    # Assume the OCI DB is PostgreSQL for this test scenario
    os.environ["PRIMARY_DB_TYPE"] = "postgresql"

    # Mock the pool setup only if you want to control pool behavior,
    # but for true integration, you'd want setup_db_connection_pool to connect to the real OCI DB.
    # If setup_db_connection_pool relies purely on env vars and standard library/driver,
    # then just setting the env vars in the AWS env is enough.
    # For simplicity, we'll let the real setup_db_connection_pool run but ensure env vars point to OCI.
    # The env vars (POSTGRES_HOST, etc.) MUST be set in the AWS execution environment.

    # We DO NOT mock the actual DB connection or cursor here, as the goal is to test the real DB call.

    yield

        os.environ["PRIMARY_DB_TYPE"] = original_db_type

# TODO: Add more cross-cloud integration tests for other scenarios (Worker saving result, API Gateway routing, Monitoring data flow)
# - OCI Worker saving result to DB (AWS or On-Prem)
# - Backend API (NCP) calling service (AWS/OCI) - would test API call library (e.g., requests) over cross-cloud network.
# - Monitoring agent (On-Prem) sending data to Prometheus/Elasticsearch (AWS) - requires configuring agents and Prometheus/Elasticsearch ingestion endpoints.
